Pabile Keyboards are keyboards and macropads powered by low-cost microcontrollers and designed for [QMK Firmware](https://qmk.fm/). Files shared here are backups and may be a work in progress. Please take time to review before use. 

QMK configuration files were compiled using [vial-qmk](https://github.com/vial-kb/vial-qmk) fork for [Vial](https://get.vial.today/) compatibility. ZMK configuration files were written for [nrfmicro](https://github.com/joric/nrfmicro).
